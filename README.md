# Score Transformation and Optimization

## What does this code do?

This code provides a framework for transforming raw model probabilities into a more interpretable score range, typically used in credit scoring or risk assessment models. It accomplishes two main tasks:

1. **Optimization**: It finds the optimal parameters for transforming probabilities into scores that follow a desired distribution.
2. **Transformation**: It applies these optimized parameters to convert probabilities into scores within a specified range (e.g., 300-850).

## How does this code work?

### 1. Score Transformation

The core of this system is the score transformation function, which converts odds (derived from probabilities) into scores. This transformation is based on three key parameters:

- PDO (Points to Double the Odds)
- Centroid odds
- Centroid score

The transformation follows this formula:

```
Score = Offset + (Factor * ln(odds))
```

Where:
- `Factor = PDO / ln(2)`
- `Offset = Centroid - (Factor * ln(Centroid odds))`

This logarithmic transformation helps convert what is often a Pareto-like distribution of probabilities into a more normal (Gaussian) distribution of scores.

### 2. Optimization Process

The optimization process uses Bayesian Optimization to find the best values for PDO, centroid odds, and centroid score. It does this by:

1. Defining an objective function that transforms the scores and compares the resulting distribution to a target distribution using chi-squared distance.
2. Exploring different combinations of parameters to minimize this distance.
3. Returning the set of parameters that produce a score distribution closest to the target.

### 3. Application

Once optimal parameters are found, they can be applied to any new set of probabilities to generate consistent, interpretable scores.

## Glossary of Terms

- **PDO (Points to Double the Odds)**: The number of score points needed to double the odds of the event (e.g., default).
- **Centroid**: A reference point in the score range, often representing an average or typical score.
- **Centroid Odds**: The odds associated with the centroid score.
- **Chi-squared Distance**: A statistical measure used here to compare the transformed score distribution to the target distribution.
- **Bayesian Optimization**: An efficient method for finding optimal parameters, especially useful when the objective function is expensive to evaluate.

## Important Notes

1. **Input Data**: The code expects a DataFrame with a column of probabilities (typically between 0 and 1).

2. **Target Distribution**: Users need to specify a target distribution, which the optimization process will try to match. This is often based on industry standards or business requirements.

3. **Score Range**: While the default range is 300-850 (common for credit scores), this can be adjusted as needed.

4. **Customization**: The code is designed to be flexible. Users can adjust the target distribution, score range, and other parameters to suit their specific needs.

5. **Performance**: The use of NumPy operations ensures efficient processing, even with large datasets.

6. **Interpretability**: The resulting scores are designed to be more intuitive and easier to interpret than raw probabilities, especially for non-technical stakeholders.

7. **Consistency**: This approach ensures that scores are consistent across different models or time periods, as long as the same transformation parameters are used.

## Use Cases

This code is particularly useful in:
- Credit scoring models
- Risk assessment in insurance
- Customer churn prediction
- Any scenario where raw model probabilities need to be converted into more interpretable scores

By using this system, organizations can maintain the predictive power of their models while presenting results in a standardized, easily understood format.
